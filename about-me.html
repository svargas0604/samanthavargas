            <article id="hello">
                <h3>Hello!</h3>
                <p>My name is Samantha Vargas and I’m a fourth-year journalism student at the University of Miami (UM). I’m a 21-year-old student writer that is looking for opportunities to contribute to a local or national newspaper/magazine.</p>
                <p>I am currently a staff writer at The Miami Hurricane, UM’S student-run newspaper. This past academic year, I have been writing profiles that highlight the work of creatives in South Florida. I have been seeking out subjects, organizing interviews, conducting interviews, and writing high-quality pieces all while earning my Bachelor’s degree.</p>
                <p>During the summer of <time datetime="2021">2021</time>, I worked as a contributing writer at Florida International University’s student run media organization, PantherNOW. I wrote three articles for their news column during my time there, where I covered issues such as the university’s COVID-19 regulations, campus events, and state laws.</p>
                <p>My passion for writing blossomed my freshman year of high school, when I decided to take my very first journalism class out of curiosity. From there, I joined my school’s newspaper, where I spent three years gaining experience in conducting interviews, scoping out and pitching stories, writing and editing articles, and, eventually, leadership. I worked my way up to the position of Editor-in-Chief.</p>
                <p>As my graduation at the University of Miami approaches, I am currently looking to build my portfolio considerably and gain more experience in the field.</p>
